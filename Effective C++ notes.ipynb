Primarily, depending on the compiler used, the macro symbol may not be tracked by the compiler and any compilation error involving `PIE` may end up referring to `3.14` rather than `PIE`. While this isn't a problem with modern compilers, it is still best to take this into consideration. A simple fix for this is to use `const double` as a global variable, or using the `static` keyword for class-specific constants which must be shared across all object instantiations."
